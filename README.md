# Superchef

Superchef is a website for sharing and discovering cooking recipes. It was developed for one of my modules in my second year of university and I wanted to focus on including recipe meta information such as the recipe time, recipe difficulty and the serving size. This project was my first experience with back-end development and I learned a lot about website structure, HTTP and, particularly, how typical user-generated content websites are built.

The instructions to run this application are below, however, the application will need access to a new MongoDB database as the old database has been taken offline.
